# Meeting Minutes: Device Status WG
## Date: 12th December 2022
## Attendees
- Eric Murray / Vodafone
- Sachin Kumar / Vodafone
- Ludovic Robert	/ Orange
- Joachim Dahlgren / Ericsson
- Mona Mokhber	/ Telefonica
## Pull Requests
- PR #8: Add documentation / DT
  
  It was agreed that:
  - Final reviews of this PR should be undertaken this week
  - Any comments to be raised by end of Friday 16th December, otherwise it will be approved
- PR #9: v0.3.0 based on Telef√≥nica proposal / Telefonica

  It was agreed that:
    - Outstanding issues / PRs in the Commonalities WG ([PR #68](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/68), [Issue #101](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/101), [Issue #105](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/105)) need to be closed before this proposal can be progressed
    - A separate API per status type (in this case, roaming status) was the best approach, and new APIs should be introduced for additional statuses (e.g. device connectivity state)
    - If additional roaming status information was to be added (e.g. visited country, or PLMN ID), this should be implemented as additional paths to support different client access rights via scopes
## Issues
- Issue #6: Issues, branches, pull requests - cleaning up
  - Issue closed

- Issue #2: Roaming Status API Proposal
