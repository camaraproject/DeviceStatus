  title: Device Reachability Status Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API provides the API consumer with the ability to subscribe to Reachability status events.

    # Introduction

    ## Reachability Status
    API consumer is able to be notified whether the reachability status of a certain user device has changed to either data- or sms-usage.
    This capability is provided via a subscription  request - in this case the reachability situation is part of the event notification, which is sent back to the event subscriber when reachability situation has changed.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier (not supported for this API version) assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capability:

    ## Device reachability status subscription

    These endpoints allow to manage event subscription on reachability device status event.
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows CloudEvents specification.

    When subscribing, it is mandatory to provide the event `types` you are subscribing to, as multiple subscription-types are managed by this API.

    Following event ``types`` are managed for this API:
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-reachability-status-subscriptions.v0.reachability-data``: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network for Data usage (regardless of the SMS reachability).

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-reachability-status-subscriptions.v0.reachability-sms``: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network only for SMS usage

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-reachability-status-subscriptions.v0.reachability-disconnected``: Event triggered when the device is not connected.

    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.device-reachability-status-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ends`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends.
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription.

    It is used in following cases:
      - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the subscription was deleted by the requester
      - the Access Token `sinkCredential` (optionally set by the requester) expiration time has been reached
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely

    **Note on combined usage of ``initialEvent`` and ``subscriptionMaxEvents``**:

    If an event is triggered following ``initialEvent`` set to true,
    this event will be counted towards ``subscriptionMaxEvents`` (if provided).


    **Clarification on ``initialEvent`` & ``event-type`` behaviour:**

    Following table illustrate behaviour regarding event triggering depending on **initial** reachability state of the device:

    | subscribed event-type | device reachability status at subscription time | event sent if ``initialEvent`` set to true | Explanation |
    | ----------------------| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------|
    | reachability-data  | Device can use data |   Yes | The device is reachable for data, so the event is triggered. |
    | reachability-data  | Device is disconnected or SMS-only | No | The device cannot use data, so no event is sent. |
    | reachability-sms  | Device can use data | No | The device can use data, but for thids event is only for SMS. |
    | reachability-sms  |  Device is SMS-only | Yes | The device supports SMS, so the event is triggered. |
    | reachability-sms  | Device is disconnected | No | The device cannot send SMS, so no event is send. |
    | reachability-disconnected  | Device can use data or SMS usage | No | The device is reachable, so no "disconnected" event is sent. |
    | reachability-disconnected  | Device is disconnected | Yes | The device is disconnected, so the event is triggered. |

    ### Notifications callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred.
    As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    _**WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the consumer side as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`.
      Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications regarding reachability-status can be received from the service provider.
      If an event occurs the application will send events to the provided webhook - `sink`._

    ## Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    ## Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ### Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    ## Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify from that phone number the device for which reachability status notifications should be provided. If the phone number is used as the device identifier when creating a subscription for a multi-SIM scenario, the API may:
    - respond with an error, or
    - provide reachability status update notifications for the multi-SIM group as a whole, or
    - provide reachability status update notifications only for a single device in the multi-SIM group, which may not be the intended device.

    Possible solutions in such a scenario include:
    - Using the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
