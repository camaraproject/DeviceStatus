  title: Connected Network Type
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to query to which Mobile Communication Technology it is connected to.

    # Introduction

    ## Connected Network Type

    The API consumer is able to query the device's connected network type. The API provider can determine this in various ways. For example, the network type can be inferred from the specific radio cell to which the device is connected, as radio cells only support a single technology. It is important to note that the API does not query the device directly.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    * **Connected Network Type** : This Type identifies the mobile technology of the network that the device is connected to (e.g. 4G, 5G, etc). It is the same as what is displayed on the device (e.g. on mobile phones). When the device moves across different areas of the network, the technology may change. As each technology is different, network capabilities may differ and MUST be checked with the API provider.
      - `2G`, if device is connected to the 2G network technology (alternative indicators such as "G" or "E" may be displayed on the device)
      - `3G`, if device is connected to the 3G network technology (alternative indicators such as "H" or "H+" may be displayed on the device)
      - `4G`, if device is connected to the 4G network technology (alternative indicators such as "LTE" or "LTE+" may be displayed on the device)
      - `5G`, if device is connected to the 5G network technology
      - `UNKNOWN` if connection [technology] can not be determined


    * **LastStatusTime** : This property specifies the time when the status was last updated. Its presence in the response indicates the freshness of the information, while its absence implies the information may be outdated or its freshness is uncertain.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ## Connected Network Type

    The endpoint `POST /retrieve` allows to get connected Network Type.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    ## Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify from that phone number the device for which the connected network type should be returned. If the phone number is used as the device identifier when querying in a multi-SIM scenario, the API may:
    - respond with an error, or
    - return a common connected network type for the multi-SIM group as a whole, or
    - return the connected network type for a single device in the multi-SIM group, which may not be the intended device.

    Possible solutions in such a scenario include:
    - Using the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
