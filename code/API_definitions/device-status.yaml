  title: Device Status
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to query device: 
      - Roaming Status
      - Connectivity Status
      
    
    Moreover, this API extends the functionality by allowing users customers to subscribe to events associated with these status queries.

    # Introduction
    
    ## Roaming Status
    API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is in roaming situation (or not). This capability is provided in 2 ways:
      - via direct request with the roaming situation in the response.
      - via a subscription  request - in this case the roaming situation is not in the response but event notification is sent back to the event subscriber when roaming situation has changed.

    The verification of the roaming situation depends on the network's ability. Additionally to the roaming status, when the device is in roaming situation, visited country information is send back in the response.

    ## Connectivity Status
    
    API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is connected to the network via data- or sms-usage. This capability is provided in 2 ways:
      - via direct request with the connectivity situation in the response.
      - via a subscription  request - in this case the connectivity situation is not in the response but event notification is sent back to the event subscriber when connectivity situation has changed.

    ## Possible Use-Cases
    Device status verification could be useful in scenario such as (not exhaustive):
      - For regulatory reasons, where a customer may need to be within a certain jurisdiction, or out with others, in order for transactions to be authorized
      - For security / fraud reasons, to establish that a customer is located where they claim to be
      - For service delivery reasons, to ensure that the customer has access to particular service, and will not incur roaming charges in accessing them


    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    * **Roaming** : Roaming status - `true`, if device is in roaming situation - `false` else.

    * **Country** : Country code and name - visited country information, provided if the device is in roaming situation.
    
    * **Connectivity** : Connectivity status.
      - `CONNECTED_SMS`, if device is connected to the network via SMS usage 
      - `CONNECTED_DATA`, if device is connected to the network via data usage' 
      - `NOT_CONNECTED`, if device is not connected to the network'

    # API Functionality    

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ## Device roaming situation

    The endpoint `POST /roaming` allows to get roaming status and country information (if device in roaming situation) synchronously.
    
    ## Device connectivity situation

    The endpoint `POST /connectivity` allows to get current connectivity status information synchronously.

    ## Device status subscription

    These endpoints allow to manage event subscription on roaming device status event. 
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows CloudEvents specification.

    It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event `type` subscribed are several are managed in this API.

    Following event ``type`` are managed for this API: 
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.roaming-status`` - Event triggered when the device switch from roaming ON to roaming OFF and conversely

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.roaming-on`` - Event triggered when the device switch from roaming OFF to roaming ON

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.roaming-off``: Event triggered when the device switch from roaming ON to roaming OFF

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.roaming-change-country``: Event triggered when the device in roaming change country code
    
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.connectivity-data``: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network for Data usage.
    
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.connectivity-sms``: Event triggered when the device is connected to the network for SMS usage
    
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.connectivity-disconnected``: Event triggered when the device is not connected.

    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.device-status.v0.subscription-ends`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends. 
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription. 
    It is used when the subscription expire time (required by the requester) has been reached or if the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely. 

    ### Notifications callback

    The  `notifications` callback describes the format of event notifications and expected responses to the messages sent when the event occurs. As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed and reachable on the listener side under 'notificationUrl` defined in the `webhook` attribute.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
