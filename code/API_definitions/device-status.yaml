  title: Device Status
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to query the roaming status of a device, and to subscribe to receive notifications when the device roaming status changes.

    # Introduction

    The API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is in a roaming situation (or not). This capability is provided in two ways:
      - via a direct request, with the current roaming status given in the response.
      - via a subscription request - in this case the roaming situation is not in the response but a notification is sent back to the subscriber when the device roaming status changes

    The verification of the roaming situation depends on the network's ability. In addition to the roaming status, visited country information is included in the response when the device is roaming.

    Device roaming status verification could be useful in scenarios such as (not exhaustive):
      - For regulatory reasons, where a customer may need to be within a certain jurisdiction, or outwith others, in order for transactions to be authorized
      - For security / fraud / fair play reasons, to establish that a customer is located where they claim to be
      - For service delivery reasons, to ensure that the customer has access to particular service, and will not incur roaming charges in accessing them


    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device (i.e. user equipment) refers to any physical entity that can connect to a mobile network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device must be provided from the following four options:
      - IPv4 address
      - IPv6 address
      - Phone number (MSISDN)
      - Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device

    * **Roaming** : Roaming status:
      - `true` if device is connected to a network other than its home network
      - `false` if connected to its home network

    * **Country** : Visited country code and name:
      - Mobile country code (MCC), as defined by ITU-T E.212 (e.g. `262`).
      - ISO country code, as defined by ISO 3166 ALPHA-2 (e.g. `DE`). A list may be provided if multiple countries share the same MCC.


    # API Functionality    

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ## Device roaming status

    The endpoint `POST /roaming` allows the API consumer to synchronously (i.e. immediately) get roaming status and country information (if the device is roaming). The response will include confirmation of the device identifier(s) used by the API implementation to determine the roaming status, but the response will never include additional identifiers that were not originally provided by the API consumer.

    ## Device status event subscription

    This endpoint allows the API consumer to create and delete event subscriptions for specific roaming device status events. The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the [CAMARA API Design Guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/blob/main/documentation/API-design-guidelines.md#121-subscription).

    Following `eventType` options are defined for this API: 
      - `ROAMING_STATUS` - This event is triggered when the device roaming status changes from roaming ON (`true`) to roaming OFF (`false`) or vice-versa

      - `ROAMING_ON` - This event is only triggered when the device changes from roaming OFF to roaming ON

      - `ROAMING_OFF` - This event is only triggered when the device changes from roaming ON to roaming OFF

      - `ROAMING_CHANGE_COUNTRY` - This event is triggered whenever the mobile country code (MCC) of the network to which the device is connected changes. Changing networks within a given country does not trigger this event.

    ## Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification that will be received by the subscription listener (API consumer) side when a subscribed event has occurred. A detailed description of the event notification mechanism is provided in the [CAMARA API Design Guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/blob/main/documentation/API-design-guidelines.md#122-event-notification).

    **WARNING**: This endpoint must be implemented on the listener (API consumer) side, as a `POST /notifications` request will be made by the device status resource server to the url provided by notification listener.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
