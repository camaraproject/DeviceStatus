  title: Connected Network Type Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API provides the customer with the ability to subscribe to notifications on changes to the connected network type of a device.

    # Introduction

    ## Connected Network Type Subscription
    API consumers can subscribe to receive notifications when the connected network type of a device changes. These notifications are delivered through CloudEvents.


    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    * **Connected Network Type**: Network Type is intended to provide insight to connected network's capabilities from standards perspective. Actual network capabilities may differ based on implementation and MUST be checked with the connected network provider.
       - `4GLTE`: if device is connected to the 4G network
       - `5GNSA`: if device's is connected to the 4G network but using 5G New Radio (NR) capability
       - `5GSA`: if device is connected to the 5G network
       - `NON3GPP4G`: if device is connected to the 4G network via WiFi network (e.g. WiFi Calling)
       - `NON3GPP5G`: if device's is connected to the 5G network via WiFi network (e.g. WiFi Calling)
       
    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capability:

    ## Connected Network Type Subscription Management

    These endpoints allow you to manage subscriptions for receiving notifications on changes to the connected network type of a device.
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows CloudEvents specification.

    **Supported Event Types:**
      - `org.camaraproject.connected-network-type.v0.network-type-changed`: This event is triggered when the connected network type of the device changes.
      
    **Notification Callbacks:**

    The  `notifications` callback describes the format of event notifications and expected responses to the messages sent when the event occurs. As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed and reachable on the listener side under `notificationUrl` defined in the `webhook` attribute.

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
