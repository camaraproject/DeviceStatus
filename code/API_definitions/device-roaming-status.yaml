  title: Device Roaming Status
  description: |
    This API provides the API consumer with the ability to query device roaming Status

    # Introduction

    ## Roaming Status
    API consumer is able to verify whether a certain user device is in roaming situation (or not).

    The verification of the roaming situation depends on the network's ability. Additionally to the roaming status, when the device is in roaming situation, visited country information could be returned in the response.

    ## Possible Use-Cases
    Roaming status verification could be useful in scenario such as (not exhaustive):
      - For regulatory reasons, where a customer may need to be within a certain jurisdiction, or out with others, in order for transactions to be authorized
      - For security / fraud reasons, to establish that a customer is located where they claim to be
      - For service delivery reasons, to ensure that the customer has access to particular service, and will not incur roaming charges in accessing them


    ## Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier (not supported for this API version) assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    * **Roaming** : Roaming status - `true`, if device is in roaming situation - `false` else.

    * **Country** : Country code and name - visited country information, provided if the device is in roaming situation.

    * **LastStatusTime** : This property specifies the time when the status was last updated. Its presence in the response indicates the freshness of the information, while its absence implies the information may be outdated or its freshness is uncertain.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capabilities:

    ## Device roaming situation

    The endpoint `POST /retrieve` allows to get roaming status and country information (if device in roaming situation) synchronously.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the provider of the application consuming the API and the operator's API exposure platform, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:

        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
