  title: Device Roaming Status Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API provides the API consumer with the ability to subscribe to Roaming status events.

    # Introduction

    ## Roaming Status
    API consumer is able to be notified whether the roaming status of a certain user device has changed.
    This capability is provided via a subscription  request - in this case the roaming situation is not in the response but event notification is sent back to the event subscriber when roaming situation has changed.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication.
      At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier (not supported for this API version) assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes following capability:

    ## Device roaming status subscription

    These endpoints allow to manage event subscription on roaming device status event.
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows CloudEvents specification.

    When subscribing, it is mandatory to provide the event `type` you are subscribing to, as multiple subscription-types are managed by this API.

    Following event ``type`` are managed for this API:
      - ``org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.roaming-status`` - Event triggered when the device switch from roaming ON to roaming OFF and conversely

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.roaming-on`` - Event triggered when the device switch from roaming OFF to roaming ON

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.roaming-off``: Event triggered when the device switch from roaming ON to roaming OFF

      - ``org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.roaming-change-country``: Event triggered when the device in roaming change country code

    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ends`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends.
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription.

    It is used in following cases:
      - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the subscription was deleted by the requester
      - the Access Token `sinkCredential` (optionally set by the requester) expiration time has been reached
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely

    **Note on combined usage of ``initialEvent`` and ``subscriptionMaxEvents``**:

    If an event is triggered following ``initialEvent`` set to true,
    this event will be counted towards ``subscriptionMaxEvents`` (if provided).

    **Clarification on ``initialEvent`` & ``event-type`` behaviour:**

    Following table illustrate behaviour regarding event triggering depending on **initial** roaming state of the device:

    | subscribed event-type | device roaming status at subscription time | event sent if ``initialEvent`` set to true |
    | ----------------------| ------------- | --------------- |
    | roaming-status  | Roaming On |   Yes |
    | roaming-status  | Roaming Off | Yes |
    | roaming-on  | Roaming On | Yes |
    | roaming-on  | Roaming Off | No |
    | roaming-off  | Roaming On | No |
    | roaming-off  | Roaming Off | Yes |
    | roaming-change-country  | Roaming Off | No(*) |
    | roaming-change-country  | Roaming On | No(*) |

    (*) Use of ``initialEvent`` has no impact on roaming-change-country event-type.

    **Clarification on ``roaming-change-country`` event-type:**

    ``roaming-change-country`` event is sent only when the device stays in roaming situation and change country.
    Suppose a device from Germany & all event types subscribed:

    - Device moves from Germany to France:
        - triggered: roaming-status & roaming-on
        - not triggered: roaming-change-country & roaming-off
    - Device moves from France to Belgium:
        - triggered: roaming-change-country
        - not triggered: roaming-status,  roaming-on & roaming-off
    - Device moves from Belgium back to Germany
        - triggered: roaming-status & roaming-off
        - not triggered: roaming-on & roaming-change-country


    ### Notifications callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred.
    As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    _**WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the consumer side as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`.
      Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications regarding reachability-status can be received from the service provider.
      If an event occurs the application will send events to the provided webhook - `sink`._

    ## Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details on how a client requests an access token. Please refer to Identify and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the Profile.

    Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

    ## Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ### Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    ## Multi-SIM scenario handling

    In multi-SIM scenarios where more than one mobile device is associated with a phone number (e.g. a smartphone with an associated smartwatch), it might not be possible to uniquely identify from that phone number the device for which roaming status notifications should be provided. If the phone number is used as the device identifier when creating a subscription for a multi-SIM scenario, the API may:
    - respond with an error, or
    - provide roaming status update notifications for the multi-SIM group as a whole, or
    - provide roaming status update notifications only for a single device in the multi-SIM group, which may not be the intended device.

    Possible solutions in such a scenario include:
    - Using the authorisation code flow to obtain an access token, which will automatically identify the intended device
    - Identifying the intended device from a unique identifier for that device, such as its source IP address and port
    - Check with the SIM provider whether a unique "secondary" phone number is already associated with each device, and use the secondary phone number to identify the intended device if available.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
